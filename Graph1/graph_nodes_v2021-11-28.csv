The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation.[supplied by OMIM, Apr 2004]."

However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action.

ENSEMBL:ENSCAFG00000023592,GENE,SLC8A1,NCX1,solute carrier family 8 member A1,"In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation.[supplied by OMIM, Apr 2004]."

The large catalytic subunit has four domains: domain I, the N-terminal regulatory domain that is processed upon calpain activation; domain II, the protease domain; domain III, a linker domain of unknown function; and domain IV, the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain. This gene encodes a large subunit. It is an atypical calpain in that it lacks the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain and instead has a divergent C-terminal domain. It is similar in organization to calpains 5 and 6. This gene is associated with type 2 or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and is located within the NIDDM1 region. Multiple alternative transcript variants have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]."

RGD:69354,GENE,Capn10,CANP10|NIDDM1,calpain 10,"Calpains represent a ubiquitous, well-conserved family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. The calpain proteins are heterodimers consisting of an invariant small subunit and variable large subunits. The large catalytic subunit has four domains: domain I, the N-terminal regulatory domain that is processed upon calpain activation; domain II, the protease domain; domain III, a linker domain of unknown function; and domain IV, the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain. This gene encodes a large subunit. It is an atypical calpain in that it lacks the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain and instead has a divergent C-terminal domain. It is similar in organization to calpains 5 and 6. This gene is associated with type 2 or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and is located within the NIDDM1 region. Multiple alternative transcript variants have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]."

The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation.[supplied by OMIM, Apr 2004]."

RGD:2320917,GENE,Dytn,NA,dystrotelin,"This gene belongs to the dystrophin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of four EF-hand motifs and a ZZ-domain. It is a likely ortholog of the Drosophila 'discontinuous actin hexagon' gene. It is noteworthy that the coding region of this gene lacks two coding exons that are found in the mouse ortholog. Human transcripts including these two exons are subject to nonsense-mediated transcript decay (NMD). On the other hand, transcripts skipping the two coding exons are expressed at very low levels. While this gene maintains an intact CDS, it may be an evolving pseudogene. However, after a discussion about this gene within the RefSeq group, as well as in the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) collaboration, it was decided to keep it as a protein-coding gene in the RefSeq, Ensembl-GENCODE and the CCDS sets.

PTPs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate monoesters specifically on tyrosine residues. Members of the PTP family share a highly conserved catalytic motif, which is essential for the catalytic activity. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP has been shown to act as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by dephosphorylating the phosphotryosine residues of insulin receptor kinase. This PTP was also reported to dephosphorylate epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, as well as JAK2 and TYK2 kinases, which implicated the role of this PTP in cell growth control, and cell response to interferon stimulation. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]."

Calcium channels are multisubunit complexes composed of alpha-1, beta, alpha-2/delta, and gamma subunits. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, whereas the others act as auxiliary subunits regulating this activity. The distinctive properties of the calcium channel types are related primarily to the expression of a variety of alpha-1 isoforms, namely alpha-1A, B, C, D, E, and S. This gene encodes the alpha-1D subunit. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2012]."

This gene is a member of the syntrophin gene family and encodes the most common syntrophin isoform found in cardiac tissues. The N-terminal PDZ domain of this syntrophin protein interacts with the C-terminus of the pore-forming alpha subunit (SCN5A) of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5. This protein also associates cardiac sodium channels with the nitric oxide synthase-PMCA4b (plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b) complex in cardiomyocytes. This gene is a susceptibility locus for Long-QT syndrome (LQT) - an inherited disorder associated with sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia - and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This protein also associates with dystrophin and dystrophin-related proteins at the neuromuscular junction and alters intracellular calcium ion levels in muscle tissue.

HGNC:11068,GENE,SLC8A1,NCX1,solute carrier family 8 member A1,"In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation.[supplied by OMIM, Apr 2004]."

ZFIN:ZDB-GENE-070124-2,GENE,dytn,NA,dystrotelin,"This gene belongs to the dystrophin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of four EF-hand motifs and a ZZ-domain. It is a likely ortholog of the Drosophila 'discontinuous actin hexagon' gene. It is noteworthy that the coding region of this gene lacks two coding exons that are found in the mouse ortholog. Human transcripts including these two exons are subject to nonsense-mediated transcript decay (NMD). On the other hand, transcripts skipping the two coding exons are expressed at very low levels. While this gene maintains an intact CDS, it may be an evolving pseudogene. However, after a discussion about this gene within the RefSeq group, as well as in the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) collaboration, it was decided to keep it as a protein-coding gene in the RefSeq, Ensembl-GENCODE and the CCDS sets.
